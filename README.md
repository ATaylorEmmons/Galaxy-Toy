# Galaxy-Toy
A model 2D galaxy using a GPU Particle System.

### Controls
Use the W and S keys to interact. This adjusts the phase. Loosely it is a rotation of the camera about the center ofthe galaxy.

## To Do's

### UI
* Time Scale
* Time Offset
* Restart simulation
* Distribution
* Place more attraction points

### Distribution
* Have a more adaptable method to distribute the particles.

### Kinematics
* Let there be more than one attraction point.
>Currently the only one is the origin
* Let the orbit decay be unique to each particle
>Currently the system scales to the center as a function of time
>A better representation of the system is a PDE representing position and time
